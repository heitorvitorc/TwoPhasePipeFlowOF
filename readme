### Instructions to setup the simulation and run in parallel (terminal)

# First apply the initial condition of the phase distribution
setFields

# Decompose domain according to /system/DecomposeParDict file
DecomposePar

# Run simulation in parallel (OpenFOAM 8) according to number of processors from DecomposeParDict
mpirun --use-hwthread-cpus -np 16 interFoam -parallel

# After the simulation is done, reconstruct the domain
reconstructPar
